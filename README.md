#Info
This project was completed for my Computational Vision class. Using VisionStartCode, my goal was to create a program capable of detecting similar objects in multiple images.

#How to compile
Type 'make all' in this directory. (Currently broken, my bad, ill fix that)

### Step 1
##### Start Image

### Step 2
##### Binary Image
###### This image is just a black & white version of the previous.

### Step 3
##### Labeled Image
###### This image has each object in the image identified and labeled with a different greyscale intensity.

### Step 4
##### Calculate Orientation Image
###### This image contains calculated orientations based on the centroid & mass of the razor and pin.
